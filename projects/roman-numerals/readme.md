# Roman numerals conversion

This project consist in two parts.

- Part 1:  Convert the Roman Numerals into decimal characters
- Part 2: Convert Decimal Characters into roman numerals


         I = 1
         V = 5
         X = 10
         L = 50
         C = 100
         D = 500
         M = 1000

I am not re-writing how roman numerals works, there is plenty of good references like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Standard_form). You can have a look at the **Standard Form** section to get a comprehensive description and examples.


## Examples

- 1234 => MCCXXXIV
- 101 => CI
- 19 => XIX


# How to test your code

We added 4 different files to help you test your code:
- [Simple tests](test-data/simple.tsv)
- [The numbers from 1 to 500](test-data/500.tsv)
- [The numbers from 1 to 10000](test-data/10000.tsv)
- [A bunch of invalid roman numbers](test-data/invalids.tsv)  (if we input any of theses, we expect an error to be generated)
